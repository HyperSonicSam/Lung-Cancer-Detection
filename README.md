# Lung-Cancer-Detection
This project uses advanced technologies like image processing, machine learning, and neural networks to improve lung cancer detection. By applying CNNs to enhanced and segmented CT scans, the model accurately identifies and classifies tumors. This aids timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially reducing lung cancer mortality rates.
